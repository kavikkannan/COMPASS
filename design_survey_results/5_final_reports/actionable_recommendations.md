# Design Survey Results & Recommendations

## Executive Summary
The primary finding from the consolidated user feedback is a profound **workflow misalignment**, where the persona (Dr. Anya Sharma, Senior Patent Agent) consistently attempts to initiate advanced, AI-driven patent functionalities (e.g., Automated Prior Art Comparison, Claim Scoping, AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation) but is repeatedly misdirected to generic document management pages, basic forms, or unhelpful error screens. This leads to severe user frustration and a perception that the promised core features are inaccessible or non-existent.

The AI assistant, while present, is frequently underutilized, silent during critical moments, or lacks the context to guide the user effectively. UI elements often exhibit readability issues (small/truncated text, unclear labels) and layouts are either too sparse or too generic, failing to support specialized patent workflows. Addressing the fundamental workflow pathways and integrating the AI assistant as a proactive guide are critical first steps to unlock the platform's potential for patent professionals.

## Cross-Page Themes
1.  **Fundamental Workflow Misalignment:** The most critical overarching issue. Dr. Sharma consistently attempts to initiate advanced, AI-driven patent functionalities but is repeatedly misdirected to generic pages (document editor, home, vault, create case forms, error pages, calendar) or basic assistant prompts. The platform fundamentally lacks clear, integrated pathways for its advertised AI-driven patent functionalities, leading to severe frustration.
2.  **Generic vs. Specialized UI:** Many pages exhibit a generic legal or document management UI, failing to cater to the specialized terminology, information density, and workflow needs of patent agents. Pages like `draft_home_page`, `draft_document_editor`, `vault`, and `vault_case_detail` feel like general-purpose tools rather than a sophisticated patent platform.
3.  **Underutilized & Disconnected AI Assistant:** The AI assistant is present but often passive, unhelpful, or silent during critical user frustration (e.g., error pages, misdirection). It fails to proactively guide the user to the desired patent-specific features or provide context-aware support.
4.  **Readability & Information Density:** Recurring issues include small or truncated text (calendar events, vault card details, assistant descriptions), generic/unhelpful placeholder text (template modal), and display errors ('Invalid Date'). This impedes quick information processing crucial for patent professionals.
5.  **Layout Inefficiencies:** Pages frequently display excessive whitespace (calendar, vault, vault_case_detail) while simultaneously compressing critical information (vault_case_detail table, calendar event names), indicating a lack of optimized layout for specialized workflows and information display.
6.  **Poor Error Handling:** Generic error messages ('Something went wrong'), absence of diagnostic detail, and an unhelpful assistant during error states significantly exacerbate user frustration, especially during high-stakes patent work.
