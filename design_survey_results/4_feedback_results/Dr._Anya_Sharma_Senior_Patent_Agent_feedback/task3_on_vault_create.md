Page Name: Vault Create Case Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I am utterly perplexed. I explicitly asked the system to help me with 'Claim Amendment Impact Simulation and Visualization' for the Aura AI application, and it has brought me to a 'Create New Case' page. This is a critical second Office Action response I'm working on, and every minute counts. I need to strategically amend claims to address new prior art and enablement, not fill out a generic case creation form. This is a complete misdirection and a waste of my valuable time."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** "The text labels like 'Case Name' and the placeholder text are clear and easy to read. The overall font choice and size are adequate for a form of this nature. However, the clarity of the text doesn't compensate for the page's irrelevance to my current task."
2. **Layout & Spacing:** "The layout is clean and simple, with fields well-spaced, which is fine for a basic form. However, for a sophisticated legal tech platform, I expect a more advanced interface, especially when dealing with complex patent prosecution tasks. The abundance of white space and the minimalist design feel somewhat bare for a tool that's supposed to handle intricate patent strategies. It doesn't offer any rich interaction or information density I'd need for my actual work."
3. **Color & Visuals:** "The blue 'Create Case' button stands out clearly against the light background, indicating its primary action. The overall color scheme is neutral and unobtrusive. There's nothing visually jarring, but also nothing that provides context or visual cues for advanced patent functionalities I'm desperate for right now."
4. **Overall Impression:** "The page looks like a very basic data entry form, completely devoid of the analytical and strategic tools I need. It's clean, yes, but utterly useless for my current, urgent task of simulating claim amendments and strategizing a response. It feels like I've been dropped into a completely different, much simpler part of the system that has no bearing on advanced patent work."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** "The features on this page, which appear to be limited to inputting basic case metadata, are entirely useless for my current task. I need to analyze claims, compare them against prior art, simulate the impact of amendments on scope, and understand allowance likelihood. None of that is present here. This page offers zero utility for patent prosecution strategy."
2. **Missing Features:** "I am missing *everything* I was looking for! I need a claim drafting editor, a prior art comparison tool, a visual representation of claim scope, a feature to simulate how amendments affect potential infringement, and an estimated likelihood of allowance. I expected to see fields to input claim language, options to select prior art references for comparison, and a way to interactively modify claim scope, not fields for a petitioner's name or filing date for a new case."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant's guidance was completely off. I clearly asked to perform a 'Claim Amendment Impact Simulation,' and it landed me on a 'Create New Case' page. This indicates a significant failure in understanding my request and directing me to the appropriate functionality. This is precisely the kind of inefficiency and frustration I hoped an AI-powered platform would eliminate."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "This page provides no indication whatsoever of available patent prosecution workflows. There are no navigation elements, no links to other tools, and no context that suggests this platform handles complex patent strategy. If the assistant is the primary interface, it must ensure I am directed to the *right* module for specific, advanced tasks like claim amendment simulation, and not a generic case creation form."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "There is absolutely no visible cross-page navigation from here that would lead me to patent-specific tools. I expected to see a clear navigation bar, or at least contextual links, that would allow me to jump to my active patent application, or to the specific 'Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact' feature the assistant should have routed me to. This page feels like a dead end for anyone trying to perform an advanced patent task."
