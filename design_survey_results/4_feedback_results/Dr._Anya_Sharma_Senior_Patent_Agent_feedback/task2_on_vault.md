**Page Name:** Vault Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `2`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I landed on this 'Vault' page expecting to dive straight into the 'Prosecution History Synthesis' for Aura AI, but all I see is a basic list of cases. While I can *see* my cases, this page provides no immediate tools or links to start the actual analysis I need. It feels like a generic file browser, not an intelligent legal tech platform."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1.  **Readability:** "The main headings like 'Vault' and 'Your Cases' are clear enough. However, the details within each case card, particularly the 'Petitioner' and 'Respondent' information and the 'X files' count, are quite small and light grey. When I'm quickly scanning through a large portfolio, I need these details to be instantly legible without having to squint or click into each card."
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** "The overall layout is clean and spacious, which is aesthetically pleasing. There's ample whitespace, especially on the right and bottom. While it doesn't feel cluttered, this empty space could potentially be utilized for more immediate functional elements like a search bar or quick filters that are critical for navigating complex portfolios."
3.  **Color & Visuals:** "The color scheme is professional and muted, which is fine. The blue 'Create case' card stands out well. However, all the existing 'Your Cases' cards look virtually identical in terms of color and icon (a grey folder). For critical, high-priority cases like Aura AI, it would be extremely helpful if there were a way to visually distinguish them – perhaps a highlight, a different color, or a custom icon – to help me locate them at a glance."
4.  **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression is that this page serves as a very basic case directory. It's a clean starting point for *creating* cases or just listing them, but for someone like me who needs to perform complex, data-intensive tasks like prosecution history synthesis, it feels significantly under-equipped. It's too minimalist for a senior agent's workflow; I need immediate access to powerful tools, not just a list of folders."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1.  **Feature Usefulness:** "The 'Create case' card is useful for new matters, and listing 'Your Cases' is fundamental. However, for efficiently managing my large caseload, the current display of case cards is severely lacking. There's no evident quick search bar or advanced filtering options to find a specific case by application number, client name ('Aura AI'), or filing date. I'd have to visually scan all cases, which is highly inefficient for a busy patent agent."
2.  **Missing Features:** "I desperately need a **prominent search bar** to quickly locate specific cases within the vault. Beyond that, **filtering capabilities** (by client, technology area, status like 'pending OA response,' or examiner) are absolutely essential. Most critically, for my current task, this page completely lacks any direct links or modules for **'Prosecution History Summary,' 'Prior Art Comparison,' or 'Argument Recommendation.'** I expect these strategic tools to be easily accessible from here, or at least from the next level down (the specific case detail page)."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1.  **Assistant Guidance:** "I'm trying to kick off the 'Prosecution History Synthesis' for Aura AI. If the assistant is my primary interface, it should not just bring me to a generic list of cases. It should either present a global search for the case first, or once on this page, immediately prompt me, 'Which case are you working on?' and upon selection, offer a clear, direct path to 'Access Prosecution History' or 'Analyze Office Action.' This page, as presented, offers no direct cues or integration points for the assistant to guide me to my specific, advanced task after I've identified the case."
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** "I need to confirm if this platform has specialized workflows for patent prosecution, such as 'Prosecution History Synthesis' or 'Claim Amendment Impact Simulation.' From this 'Vault' page, there's absolutely no indication of such advanced capabilities. The assistant should proactively inform me about these powerful tools, perhaps suggesting, 'To analyze the Aura AI Office Action, I can initiate the Prosecution History Synthesis workflow. Would you like to proceed?' But this page doesn't even hint at their existence."
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** "This page essentially acts as a gate to individual case detail pages. However, for a complex platform, I would expect more robust cross-page navigation, especially given the assistant's role as a central hub. Once I select 'Aura AI', I need the assistant to immediately offer to take me to the relevant modules – 'Document Analysis,' 'Claim Drafting,' 'Prosecution History.' There are no visible global navigation elements or a clear 'next step' *on this page* that the assistant could point me to, to access these specialized patent prosecution features."
