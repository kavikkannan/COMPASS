**Page Name:** Error Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? **1**
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? **1**
3. **Open Feedback:** "I was trying to leverage the 'Prosecution History Summary' module to quickly synthesize critical enablement rejections for Aura AI, which is absolutely vital with this looming deadline, but I've landed on this 'Something went wrong' page instead. It's incredibly frustrating to hit such a roadblock when I'm under pressure and need to be strategically thinking, not debugging the system."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** The "Something went wrong" header is very clear and the dynamic error message ("We're sorry, an unexpected error has occurred. Please try again or go back to the home page.") is also legible. The button labels are distinct. No issues with the readability of the text that is present.
2. **Layout & Spacing:** The layout is clean and minimalist, with good spacing between the elements. It effectively communicates an error state without being cluttered.
3. **Color & Visuals:** The prominent red error icon clearly signifies a problem, and the clean white background with dark text maintains a professional aesthetic. The blue action buttons are clear and stand out. Visually, it effectively conveys an error.
4. **Overall Impression:** "While the page itself is clean and visually professional, clearly communicating an error, my overall impression is one of intense frustration. It's a dead end when I'm trying to perform a high-stakes, time-sensitive task. It provides no context as to *why* it went wrong, which is crucial for someone like me who needs to quickly understand and resolve issues, not just hit 'try again' blindly."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** The "Try again" and "Go back" buttons are essential for any error page, offering basic recovery options. The clear "Something went wrong" message and icon are also useful for immediately informing me of a problem.
2. **Missing Features:** "I desperately need more diagnostic detail. Was it a server timeout? A specific data retrieval error for the Aura AI application? An issue with the 'Prosecution History Summary' module itself? Without specific error codes or a log of what happened, I have no insight into the root cause, making it impossible to troubleshoot or even report accurately to support. A direct link to report a bug or contact support *from this page* would also be a critical omission."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant is conspicuously present in the bottom right, yet it's completely silent and unhelpful during this critical error state. I expected it to proactively jump in, perhaps saying, 'It appears there was an issue retrieving the prosecution history for Aura AI. Would you like me to attempt the query again, or would you prefer to try a different application, or perhaps connect you with technical support?' Its current passivity makes me feel stranded."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "This error page completely disrupts my workflow and offers no path to rediscover or restart it effectively. I was clearly on a path to 'Prosecution History Synthesis,' and the assistant isn't helping me understand how to recover that specific task or suggest alternative ways to get the information I need, which is highly inefficient."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "The 'Go back' button will likely take me to a generic home page, forcing me to completely restart my navigation to the 'Prosecution History Summary' module and re-enter my parameters for Aura AI. I expected the assistant, as the intelligent agent, to retain context of my last action and offer a more direct path back to my specific task or at least to the 'Prosecution' section of the application, rather than a full reset."
