**Page Name:** Template Customization Modal

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I am utterly perplexed and, frankly, quite frustrated. I was specifically looking for the 'Prosecution History Summary' module to quickly get an interactive timeline and synthesize arguments for the lingering enablement issues. Instead, I've been dropped into a 'Customize Template' modal, and what's worse, the template is for a 'PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE'! This is completely irrelevant to patent prosecution, and absolutely nowhere near what I need to address a critical second Office Action. My time is precious, and this feels like a significant misdirection that wastes it when I'm under immense deadline pressure."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** "The text within the modal is generally readable in terms of font size and contrast against the background. The questions themselves are clear if you were actually trying to customize *this type* of template. However, the sheer irrelevance of the template title ('PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE') and the customization questions ('What is the name of the software project?', 'What is the main objective of this project?') makes reading them painful because I immediately know I'm in the wrong place."
2. **Layout & Spacing:** "The layout of this modal, if it were the *correct* feature, is clean and well-spaced. The 'Choose an option' cards are distinct, and the customization questions are presented clearly with enough room. The footer buttons are logically placed. However, the overall layout simply highlights that this is a document generation tool, not an analytical one, which is what I actually need."
3. **Color & Visuals:** "The color scheme is professional and subdued, which I appreciate. The icons (FileText, Sparkles) are clear indicators for their respective actions *within the context of template customization*. However, the large blank space intended for a template preview just serves as a visual reminder that I'm looking at a generic document template, not an interface for complex patent analysis or strategy, which feels completely misaligned with my actual task."
4. **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression of *this modal itself* is that it's a well-designed component for *template customization*. However, as Dr. Sharma, my impression is one of deep disappointment and lost time because I was routed to a page that is entirely unrelated to my urgent need for 'Prosecution History Synthesis and Argument Recommendation.' It indicates a fundamental disconnect between my stated task and the system's response, making me question the specificity and intelligence of the platform for patent law."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** "The features on this modal are completely *useless* for my current task. I need to *analyze existing prosecution history* for enablement arguments and prior art distinctions, not generate a new document from a template, especially not a divorce petition! The 'Customize with AI' here is about filling in blanks for a document, which is not at all what I need when I want AI to *synthesize complex legal arguments* from a vast amount of historical data and suggest strategic responses."
2. **Missing Features:** "I desperately need a 'Prosecution History Summary' feature. I'm looking for an interactive timeline showing all prior OAs, responses, specific examiner rejections related to enablement, and my previous counter-arguments. I also need something that can suggest *new* arguments based on successful prosecution strategies for similar enablement issues, or even identify potential 'file wrapper estoppel' traps. This modal doesn't even come close to offering any of that."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "If the assistant actually led me to *this specific modal* when I asked for 'Prosecution History Synthesis and Argument Recommendation,' then its guidance is fundamentally flawed. It has completely misinterpreted my intent and sent me to a generic document creation tool instead of a specialized analytical one. I expected the assistant to take me directly to the relevant module, or at least prompt me with clarifying questions to ensure it understood my complex patent prosecution needs, not just throw me into an unrelated template gallery."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "On this page, there's absolutely nothing that helps me discover other patent-specific workflows or modules. It's a dead end focused solely on *this* generic template. I can't see how this page connects to the 'Prosecution History Summary' or 'Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact' features I was expecting. It makes me feel like the system lacks comprehensive, patent-specific workflows, or that I've lost the thread of the 'intelligent agentic flow system' entirely."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "This modal provides no visible cross-page navigation back to core patent prosecution features or other analytical tools. The only options are to 'Cancel', 'Use As-Is', or 'Create Customized' for *this template*. I feel completely stuck here and would have to manually close this modal and then navigate back to the main assistant interface to try and re-initiate my task, which is incredibly inefficient and frustrating when I'm racing against a deadline."
