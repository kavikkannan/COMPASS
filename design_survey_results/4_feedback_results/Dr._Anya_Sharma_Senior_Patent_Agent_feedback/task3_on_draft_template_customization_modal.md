**Page Name:** Template Customization Modal

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1.  **How easy was it to start the task on this page?** `1`
2.  **How clear was the path to completing the task from here?** `1`
3.  **Open Feedback:** "I was specifically looking to utilize the 'Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact' feature to model and visualize potential claim amendments for Aura AI's patent application. Instead, I've landed on a 'Customize Template' modal, and the template it's showing is for a 'PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BY A DECREE OF DIVORCE BY.' This is utterly irrelevant to my task of strategically addressing patent prior art and enablement rejections for a neural network architecture. I feel completely derailed and frustrated that I've been led down such a wrong path when I'm facing tight deadlines for a critical Office Action response."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1.  **Readability:** The text within the modal itself is generally clear and readable in terms of font size and contrast. However, the prominent display of the incorrect template title, "PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BY A DECREE OF DIVORCE BY," only serves to highlight the severe contextual mismatch, making the *content* itself the problem, not its readability.
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** The modal's layout is clean and well-structured for a generic template customization process. The options and questions are presented logically with good spacing between elements. However, this well-organized layout for a non-patent template is frustrating because it implies I'm on the right track when I am clearly not, diverting my attention from my real task.
3.  **Color & Visuals:** The colors are standard and the icons (FileText, Sparkles) are appropriate for a general template customization. However, these visuals do not convey anything about patent claims, technical scope, or legal strategy, which is what I would expect for a "Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact" tool. The blank placeholder for the template image is also a missed opportunity; it could have provided a visual cue about the template's *actual* content.
4.  **Overall Impression:** My overall impression of this page is one of profound confusion and disappointment. While the modal itself is technically well-designed for a generic template, it is completely out of context for my actual need. It feels like a roadblock rather than a helpful tool, especially given the urgency of my patent prosecution tasks.

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1.  **Feature Usefulness:** The "Customize with AI" feature and its associated questions ("What is the name of the software project?", "What is the main objective of this project?") are completely useless for my task. I need to analyze claim language, compare it against specific technical disclosures in prior art, assess enablement, and simulate the legal impact of amendments. These generic questions offer absolutely no utility for patent claim strategy. This page offers none of the specific analytical capabilities I require for patent prosecution.
2.  **Missing Features:** I am missing *every* feature relevant to "Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact Simulation." I need to be able to input specific claim language, identify claim elements, map those elements to prior art references (specifically the new academic paper), visualize changes in claim scope, analyze the implications for infringement, and receive data-driven estimates on allowance likelihood. This page provides none of these essential functionalities.

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1.  **Assistant Guidance:** The assistant has completely failed to guide me to the correct feature. I requested a specialized tool for patent claim analysis, and I've been directed to a generic template customization modal for a divorce petition. This indicates a severe lack of contextual understanding or an inability to properly map my patent-specific request to the appropriate specialized tools within the platform. I expected to be taken directly to a workflow where I could start analyzing or drafting claim amendments, not a general document generator.
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** This page actively hinders workflow discovery for patent professionals. It presents a generic legal template process, making me question if specialized patent workflows even exist or if the assistant can effectively navigate me to them. I need to be able to see and access patent-specific tools directly, not be sidetracked by unrelated templates.
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** There is no clear way to pivot from this modal to the correct "Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact" feature or any other patent-related section of the platform. My only options are to 'Cancel' or 'Use As-Is'/'Create Customized' for *this divorce petition template*. I expected a clear path back or forward to my actual task, perhaps a breadcrumb or a direct link to other patent tools, rather than being trapped in an irrelevant modal.
