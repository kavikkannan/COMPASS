Page Name: Vault Create Case Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I was trying to utilize the platform's AI-driven prior art comparison tool to dissect a newly cited academic paper for the 'Aura AI' patent application. Instead, I've landed on a 'Create New Case' page. This is completely irrelevant to my current, urgent task of analyzing prior art for an *existing* prosecution. I cannot begin my task here."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** "The labels for the fields, like 'Case Name' and 'Description', are clear and easy to read. The placeholder text within each input field, such as 'e.g. ABC Corp. v. XYZ Ltd.', also provides helpful context and is perfectly legible. Overall, the text on this form is clear and well-presented for its intended purpose of data entry."
2. **Layout & Spacing:** "The layout is clean and straightforward. Each field and its label are vertically stacked with good spacing in between, which prevents a cluttered feeling. The 'Metadata (Optional)' section is clearly delineated, making it easy to distinguish between core case details and additional information. It's a standard, functional form layout."
3. **Color & Visuals:** "The minimalist color scheme is unobtrusive, allowing focus on the form fields themselves. The blue 'Create Case' button stands out appropriately as the primary action. While I'm not seeing any error messages now, I'd expect clear visual cues for those. For a purely administrative form, the visual design is appropriate and clean."
4. **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression is one of frustration and misdirection. While this page is a perfectly clean and functional form for *creating a new case*, it does absolutely nothing to help me with my actual, pressing task of analyzing prior art for an existing application. It feels like a roadblock rather than a helpful tool in my workflow."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** "The features on this page, such as input fields for 'Case Name,' 'Description,' and 'Metadata,' are clearly designed for creating a new administrative case file. For someone starting a brand new litigation or patent family, these would be useful. However, for my current task of 'Automated Prior Art Comparison and Discrepancy Analysis,' these features are entirely useless. They offer no functionality for uploading documents, comparing text, or highlighting differences between claims and prior art."
2. **Missing Features:** "I am missing every single feature related to prior art analysis. I expected to see an option to upload the new academic paper, a way to select the 'Aura AI' patent application and its claims, and then an interface to automatically map and compare the disclosures. I need tools for generating a report of distinctions, not administrative case creation fields."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant has failed to guide me correctly. I explicitly needed to perform 'Automated Prior Art Comparison and Discrepancy Analysis' for an *existing* application. Being directed to a 'Create New Case' page is a complete misinterpretation of my request. I expected the assistant to either take me directly to the relevant analysis tool or, at minimum, to a page where I could select the 'Aura AI' application and then initiate the prior art comparison workflow."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "If the assistant is the primary interface, its inability to direct me to the correct 'Prior Art Comparison' workflow suggests a serious gap in its understanding of patent prosecution tasks. I need to know if the system even *has* a well-defined and accessible workflow for this critical function, or if the assistant simply isn't intelligent enough to connect me to specialized patent tools. This failure makes me question the system's ability to support complex IP workflows."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "From this 'Create New Case' page, there is no visible navigation menu, no breadcrumbs, and no obvious links to other parts of the system, particularly the specific patent application I need to work on. I feel stuck on this administrative form. I expected a clear way to navigate back to my active cases, a general dashboard, or directly to the 'Aura AI' application's details where I could then access specific analytical tools."
