**Page Name:** Template Customization Modal

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1.  How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2.  How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3.  **Open Feedback:** "I am utterly frustrated. I was specifically trying to use the 'Response Drafting Assistant' for a *critical Office Action response* for Aura AI, my client's cutting-edge neural network. I clicked on what I expected to be a patent-specific template or a prompt to generate one, but this modal has presented me with a 'PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BY A DECREE OF DIVORCE BY.' This is completely irrelevant and a severe misstep by the system. My task is to address complex AI architecture and prior art; seeing a divorce petition template here means I cannot start my actual work at all. This is a significant waste of my time, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid with AI tools."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1.  **Readability:** "The text within the modal itself is clear and easy to read. The template title, the options, and the customization questions are all presented in a legible font size and color. This makes it even more jarring that the content is so profoundly incorrect; I can clearly read *what* the system has gotten wrong."
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** "The modal's layout is visually clean and well-organized. There's good spacing between the template preview, the 'Choose an option' cards, and the 'Customization Questions' section. The footer buttons are also well-separated. The structure itself is intuitive, which is why the incorrect content is such a letdown."
3.  **Color & Visuals:** "The color scheme is professional and subdued, which I appreciate. The icons, particularly the document icon for 'Use Template As-Is' and the sparkle icon for 'Customize with AI,' are clear and convey their meaning effectively. The 'Create Customized' button uses the same sparkle icon, which visually reinforces the AI functionality. There are no visual elements that are confusing or distracting, but this doesn't compensate for the fundamental content error."
4.  **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression of the *design* of this modal is positive â€“ it's polished and easy on the eyes. However, my overall impression of its *functionality in this context* is extremely poor. It gives me the distinct feeling that the system is either incredibly generic or has made a fundamental mistake in retrieving the correct template. For a tool meant to handle cutting-edge patent prosecution, encountering a divorce petition template is disconcerting and severely undermines my confidence in its ability to provide specialized assistance for Aura AI's critical response."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1.  **Feature Usefulness:** "The 'Customize with AI' feature, with its 'Customization Questions,' *would be* incredibly useful if it were tied to the correct template. I need to synthesize arguments and generate drafts quickly, so the concept of feeding key information to the AI to personalize a response template aligns perfectly with my goals of efficiency and reducing manual tasks. However, in this instance, it's completely useless as the template itself is for a divorce petition, not a patent OA response."
2.  **Missing Features:** "I desperately need context! There is no indication of *which patent application* this template is supposedly for, like 'Aura AI, Application No. XXXXX.' More critically, since the template is wrong, I need a 'Search for Template' or 'Go to Template Gallery' button *within this modal* so I don't have to cancel and navigate back. I also expected some way to confirm the case or client I'm working on to ensure I'm using the right tools for the right job."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1.  **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant must have guided me here, but it has failed spectacularly. I asked for help with an 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation and Review' for a patent application, and it brought me to a divorce petition template. This clearly indicates the assistant either misunderstood my request or lacks the specialization to differentiate between legal domains. Its guidance was not helpful; it was misleading and detrimental to my progress."
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** "This page actively *hinders* workflow discovery. Instead of revealing relevant patent prosecution workflows, the assistant has routed me to a generic and incorrect template, completely obscuring any specialized tools that might actually be available. I'm looking for patent-specific tools to overcome enablement rejections and new prior art, not divorce forms."
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** "As a modal, this page offers only 'Cancel' to return. There's no way for me to directly navigate to other crucial modules for Aura AI's case, such as the prior art comparison tool, the claim amendment simulator, or the overall application dashboard, without closing this and starting over. I need seamless transitions between tasks, especially when dealing with such critical, interconnected issues. I feel stuck and disconnected from the broader context of my work."
