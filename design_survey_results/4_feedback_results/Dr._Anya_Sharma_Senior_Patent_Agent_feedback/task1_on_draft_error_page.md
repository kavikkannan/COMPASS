**Page Name:** Error Page
**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I was trying to upload the newly cited academic paper for an automated comparison, which is absolutely critical for Aura AI's response, and then this infuriating error page popped up! I cannot start my task here. It's incredibly frustrating to hit a dead end when I'm under such a tight deadline, and I need to dissect this new prior art, not deal with system errors. There's no path forward for my actual work."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** "The main error message and title, 'Something went wrong,' are perfectly readable and clear with good contrast. The supporting text explaining that the team has been notified and advising me to try again is also legible. There are no issues with font size or color contrast on the text presented."
2. **Layout & Spacing:** "The layout is clean and uncluttered, which is appreciated when I'm already stressed. The 'Try again' and 'Go back' buttons are well-centered and distinct from each other, making them easy to identify and click without mis-selecting."
3. **Color & Visuals:** "The colors are professional and consistent with the overall platform's apparent branding, visible in the chatbot. The error icon is standard and immediately recognizable, signaling an issue without being overly alarming, which is good. Thereâ€™s nothing jarring about the visual design here."
4. **Overall Impression:** "The page itself looks clean and professional, but my overwhelming impression is one of intense frustration. It's a nicely designed roadblock that is preventing me from performing a critical task under severe time pressure. It feels like an elegant 'no entry' sign when I'm trying to race forward."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** "The 'Try again' and 'Go back' buttons are useful in a generic sense for attempting to reset the system. However, for my urgent task of performing a detailed prior art comparison, they don't actually help me progress in my workflow. They just offer a way to potentially escape this current error state, which isn't the same as moving my work forward."
2. **Missing Features:** "I desperately need more context. What *exactly* went wrong? Was it a file upload issue with the academic paper? A processing error during the AI comparison? I need a way to immediately report the specific error to support with more detail than 'an unexpected error occurred.' Furthermore, I wish the system could either *remember* where I was in the 'Automated Prior Art Comparison' process or guide me directly back to that specific workflow once the error is cleared, rather than forcing me to 'Go back to homepage' and start navigating all over again."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant is visible on the page, but it's completely passive. I would expect it to offer immediate, context-sensitive help here. For example, 'It looks like you encountered an error during prior art upload. Would you like me to attempt the upload again, or should I log this specific issue with support and help you start a new prior art analysis session?' Or even, 'I've logged this error for our technical team. In the meantime, would you like me to guide you to another module, such as the Prosecution History Summary, while this issue is being resolved?' Its current silence is a missed opportunity."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "As this is an error page, its primary purpose isn't workflow discovery. However, the chatbot assistant, being ever-present, should be a consistent hub for it. It's not proactively suggesting any alternative workflows or how to get back on track with my prior art comparison, which it should be doing in this frustrating situation."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "The 'Go back' button simply sends me to the homepage, which means I'll have to manually navigate back to the 'Automated Prior Art Comparison' workflow, assuming 'Try again' doesn't work. There's no clear way to immediately jump to another specific module, like the 'Prosecution History Summary' or 'Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact,' if I decide to shift focus temporarily while this error persists. The assistant isn't offering any shortcuts here either."
