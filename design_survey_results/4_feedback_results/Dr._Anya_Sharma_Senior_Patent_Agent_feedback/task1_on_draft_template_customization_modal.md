**Page Name:** Template Customization Modal

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I was trying to use the 'Response Drafting Assistant' to generate a preliminary draft for Aura AI's critical Second Office Action, which covers a novel neural network architecture. I clicked on what I thought would be a patent response template, but this modal popped up showing a 'PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE BY A DECREE OF DIVORCE BY.' I immediately thought, 'What on earth?!' I am a Senior Patent Agent specializing in AI, not a family lawyer. This is completely irrelevant and incredibly frustrating given the tight deadline for Aura AI. I expected to see a template for an Office Action response, or at the very least, something in the intellectual property domain, not a divorce petition."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** "The titles and main text, like the template name and options, are generally clear and easy to read. However, the placeholder text within the customization questions, like 'Enter your answer for: What is the name of the software project?', is redundant. The question itself is already above the text area; just 'Enter your answer' would be less visually noisy and equally effective."
2. **Layout & Spacing:** "The overall layout of the modal is clean and the spacing between elements is decent. The options are clearly separated, and the customization questions are well-grouped. The buttons at the bottom are also well-aligned and easy to distinguish. My issue isn't with the general layout, but rather the content within it, which is entirely misaligned with my current task."
3. **Color & Visuals:** "The icons used for 'Use Template As-Is' (FileText) and 'Customize with AI' (Sparkles) are appropriate and help to quickly differentiate the options. The button colors are standard and legible. There aren't any glaring visual issues, but again, the visual elements don't help alleviate the confusion caused by the template's content."
4. **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression is one of significant disconnect and frustration. The modal itself *looks* like a professional tool, but its immediate content makes it feel completely broken in the context of my workflow. It's disorienting to be presented with something so utterly unrelated to a high-stakes patent prosecution task. It makes me question the system's ability to understand context."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** "The *concept* of 'Customize with AI' is exactly what I need and what I was hoping for when using the 'Response Drafting Assistant.' I want to input specifics about Aura AI's invention and the examiner's rejections, and have the system intelligently tailor a response. The 'Customization Questions' feature for project name and objective *could* be useful if this were a *patent* application template. However, since the template presented is for a divorce petition, all these potentially useful features are rendered entirely useless to me right now. I can't use them to address the enablement rejection or differentiate the new prior art for Aura AI."
2. **Missing Features:** "I desperately need a robust way to *filter or search for specific template types* relevant to patent prosecution, especially 'Office Action Response' or 'Amendment and Response to OA'. If the system presents a generic template, there should be an option *within this modal* or a clearer path to a template gallery where I can specify 'patent' or 'AI' or 'OA response' to find what I actually need. I also need better context awareness from the system â€“ if I just used the 'Prosecution History Summary' and 'Claim Amendment Impact' tools for a patent application, why would it offer me a divorce petition template?"

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant's guidance has completely gone off the rails here. I was explicitly trying to complete the 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation' task for a patent application. If this modal is the result of that guidance, then the assistant has failed spectacularly to understand my context and needs. I expected the assistant to recognize I'm in a deep patent prosecution workflow and surface *only* patent-specific templates, ideally pre-filtered for 'Office Action responses.' This feels like a major misstep, wasting my precious time."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "This experience makes me question how effectively I can discover specialized workflows through the assistant. If it can lead me to a family law template when I'm working on advanced AI patents, then I don't trust it to show me *all* the relevant patent tools. I need a clear way to inquire, 'Show me all available workflows and templates *specifically for patent prosecution*,' and then ideally, 'Show me those relevant to Office Actions' so this kind of irrelevant template doesn't appear."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "From this modal, I feel stuck. If I click 'Cancel,' what happens? Does the assistant re-engage and ask me for more details? Or do I have to start my search for a relevant template all over again from a general templates gallery? I don't see any immediate navigation back to a templates selection screen or a way to refine my search without exiting this modal completely. I expected a 'Back to Templates' button or a direct link to a patent-specific template category."
