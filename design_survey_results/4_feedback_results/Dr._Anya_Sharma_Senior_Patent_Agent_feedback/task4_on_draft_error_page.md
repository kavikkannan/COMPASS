**Page Name:** Error Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1.  How easy was it to start the task on this page? **1**
2.  How clear was the path to completing the task from here? **1**
3.  **Open Feedback:** "I was trying to use the 'Response Drafting Assistant' to generate a critical Office Action response for Aura AI, and now I'm staring at 'Something went wrong.' This is incredibly frustrating, especially with a tight deadline looming. It doesn't tell me *what* went wrong, if my previous arguments or claim amendments were saved, or if the AI simply crashed. I expected specific guidance from the assistant on how to recover or what happened, not a generic dead end. This feels like a major setback for a task that demands strategic precision and efficiency."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1.  **Readability:** "The general title 'Something went wrong' is clear enough, but it's utterly unhelpful. The crucial piece of information—the specific error message or details of *why* the AI-assisted draft generation failed—is completely missing from this display. If there is a dynamic error message as described, it needs to be front and center, highly readable, and provide actionable intelligence, not just a vague statement."
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** "The layout is clean, but the 'Try again' and 'Go back' buttons are too generic and given equal prominence. For a high-stakes task like patent response drafting, I'd expect a primary recovery action that's context-aware, not just a shot in the dark. There's nothing to guide me on which action might be more appropriate given the error, leading to a hesitant and potentially wasteful choice."
3.  **Color & Visuals:** "The red 'X' icon is a standard error visual, but it's too generic for a sophisticated legal tech platform. I'd expect a visual cue that helps me understand the *type* of error (e.g., data input error, server issue, AI model failure) or perhaps even a visual representation of where in the drafting process the error occurred. This current visual offers no diagnostic value."
4.  **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression is one of deep frustration and a lack of trust in the system's robustness at a critical moment. This page feels like a generic system crash from a basic application, not an intelligent platform designed to streamline complex patent prosecution. It completely abandons me without any specific direction or reassurance regarding my ongoing 'AI-Assisted Draft Response' task. It forces me to guess and potentially lose valuable time and work."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1.  **Feature Usefulness:** "From *this* error page, the 'Try again' and 'Go back' options are barely 'features'; they're basic recovery buttons that don't address my core problem. 'Try again' is a gamble that might just lead to the same error, and 'Go back' likely means losing the context of my work and having to re-navigate or re-enter data. Neither helps me efficiently complete my specific task of drafting the response."
2.  **Missing Features:** "I desperately need a feature that provides specific diagnostic details about the error, such as a technical error code, a description of *which part* of the 'Response Drafting Assistant' failed (e.g., 'Prior art mapping encountered an unhandled exception,' or 'Claim amendment analysis timed out'). Critically, there's no visible 'Save Draft' or 'Load Last Auto-Saved Draft' option, which is paramount for preventing loss of work. I also need a direct 'Report this issue to support with full context' feature, which should automatically capture my current task, the application details, and the technical error logs, saving me from having to manually recreate the problem description."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1.  **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant chatbot is described as the 'primary interface,' yet it is completely silent on this critical error page. I absolutely expected it to immediately interject, acknowledge the error, and offer specific, context-aware guidance related to my 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation' task. For example, it should say, 'Dr. Sharma, it appears the AI assistant encountered an issue during draft generation. Would you like me to attempt to regenerate the last section, review the input data for discrepancies, or should we escalate this to support with a detailed log?' Its current silence is a major failure of the 'agentic flow.'"
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** "On this page, I can't discover any workflows at all because the current workflow—generating the response—has evidently failed, and the assistant isn't offering any alternatives or next steps. The assistant should proactively suggest how to recover or what alternative steps I can take to continue my patent prosecution workflow without being stuck on this generic error."
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** "If I click 'Go back,' I have no idea where it will take me. Will it be the application home page, forcing me to start over and lose context? I need specific options to return to the *exact module* I was working in (e.g., 'Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact,' or the 'Prosecution History Summary') without having to navigate through several menus. This page offers no intelligent navigation back into my ongoing work for Aura AI."
