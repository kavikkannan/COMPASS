**Page Name:** Vault Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
*(Rate on a scale of 1-5, where 1 = Very Difficult and 5 = Very Easy)*
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I've just received a critical second Office Action for Aura AI, and I need to immediately access the 'Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact' feature to strategically draft responses and simulate potential claim changes. Why am I looking at a general list of case files? This page doesn't offer any tools for the complex analysis I need right now. I expected to be taken directly to the analytical tool, or at least to the specific Aura AI case *with* prominent access to that feature, not this high-level overview."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** The main titles "Vault" and "Your Cases" are clear. The case names are bold and legible. However, the smaller text under the case names, like "test 2 description" or "Petitioner: abc," is quite small and light, making it a bit difficult to quickly scan for specific details, especially if I had a lot of similar-sounding cases. The "0 files" or "1 files" is okay.
2. **Layout & Spacing:** The layout is clean and spacious, which is generally good for visual clarity. The "Create case" card is prominently displayed and distinct. The grid of case cards is well-organized. However, the vast empty space below the case cards suggests a lot of unused screen real estate that could potentially house quick actions or filters relevant to case management, if not the analytical tools I actually need.
3. **Color & Visuals:** The color scheme is very understated with mostly white and light grey, and a subtle blue for clickable elements and the "Create case" card. This provides a clean, professional look. The folder icons are standard and easily recognizable. However, there's nothing visually that indicates the *status* of a case (e.g., nearing a deadline, recent OA received), which would be incredibly helpful on a case management hub.
4. **Overall Impression:** The page feels very sparse and generic. It's a clean, basic file viewer, but it lacks the richness and functionality I'd expect from a central case management hub within a sophisticated legal tech product, especially given the context of needing advanced analytical tools. It feels like a starting point, not a working environment for a senior patent agent.

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** For my current task of "Claim Amendment Impact Simulation," this page is entirely unhelpful. Its *intended* purpose of storing and managing cases is apparent, and clicking on a case card would presumably take me to a case detail page, but there's no direct way to initiate complex analysis from *here*. I need to dive into the technical specifics of a case, not just browse its title.
2. **Missing Features:** I am desperately looking for any indication of the "Claim Scoping & Amendment Impact" feature, or even a search bar to quickly find the "Aura AI" case to begin with. There's no visible search, no filters, no sorting options, and certainly no links to specific analytical tools. I need a way to filter by prosecution status, examiner, client, or even just a free-text search. Without these, finding the *specific* Aura AI case out of potentially hundreds could be tedious.

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** If the assistant led me to *this* page after I indicated I needed to perform "Claim Amendment Impact Simulation," then its guidance is severely flawed. This page is completely disconnected from the actual task. I expected the assistant to either take me *directly* to the "Claim Scoping" tool for a specified case or at least to the case's detail page where that tool would be readily accessible. Landing me here makes me question the assistant's intelligence and ability to understand my immediate need.
2. **Workflow Discovery:** This page offers no insight into available workflows, especially not advanced patent prosecution workflows. I see "Create case" and existing cases, which are fundamental, but nothing that suggests the availability of sophisticated tools like prior art comparison, prosecution history synthesis, or claim amendment simulation. I can't discover relevant workflows from this interface.
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** While clicking on a case card would navigate me to a case-specific page, there's no visible global navigation, breadcrumbs, or explicit links to other high-level feature sets (like a dedicated "Analytics" or "Drafting" section) that the assistant might have mentioned. This page feels like a silo. If the assistant suggested a specific workflow, I need a clear, direct path to it from wherever I am.
