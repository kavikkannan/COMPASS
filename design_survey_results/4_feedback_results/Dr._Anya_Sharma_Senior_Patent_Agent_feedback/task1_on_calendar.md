**Page Name:** CALENDAR PAGE

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I'm under immense pressure to tackle this second Office Action for Aura AI, which means immediately diving into **Automated Prior Art Comparison and Discrepancy Analysis**. I asked the system to help me with this, and somehow I've landed squarely on the 'My Legal Calendar' page. This isn't where I need to be at all; it's a complete misdirection and a frustrating waste of precious time when I need to be analyzing complex technical distinctions, not scheduling a meeting."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** "The event names on the calendar grid, like 'Lexamplify...' and 'Train to KAT...', are quite small and truncated. While I understand space is limited, for critical deadlines and important meetings, I need to be able to quickly read the full event title without having to click into each one. A tooltip on hover would be a minor improvement, but clearer, less truncated text would be ideal."
2. **Layout & Spacing:** "The overall layout is clean and spacious, which is generally good. The 'Add Event' button is clear and easy to find. However, I noticed the 'Month/Week/Day/Agenda' view toggles feel a bit visually disconnected from the calendar itself; they're positioned above 'Upcoming Events' but their direct impact on the grid isn't immediately obvious, although it becomes clear upon interaction."
3. **Color & Visuals:** "The color scheme is professional and muted, which I appreciate for long working hours. The blue highlighting for the active 'Month' view and the 'Add Event' button provides good visual cues for interactivity. However, there isn't much visual differentiation for specific event types (e.g., deadlines vs. meetings), which could be useful for a quick scan of my priorities."
4. **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression of *this page as a calendar* is that it's functional and aesthetically pleasing. It looks like a competent tool for general scheduling. However, as Dr. Anya Sharma, my impression of *being on this page right now* is one of deep frustration. It's well-designed for its purpose, but its purpose is not my current, critical priority, and I feel detoured from my real work."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** "The basic calendar views (Month, Week, Day, Agenda) are fundamental and necessary for managing my schedule. The implied ability to add and manage events is also crucial. Integrating with Google Calendar is absolutely essential; I rely on that for all my external and internal appointments and deadlines. Without that, this calendar would be nearly useless to me."
2. **Missing Features:** "Considering my role and the high-stakes nature of my work, I'm missing several critical features here. First, there's no obvious way to filter events by *client* or *specific patent application*, which would be invaluable for managing my large portfolio. Second, I'd expect an automated way to pull in official Office Action deadlines or PTAB hearing dates directly from a prosecution tracker, rather than manually adding them. Finally, if I see an event like an 'OA Response Due,' I need to be able to click it and immediately jump to that specific patent application's file or the OA document itself, for context and action."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant's guidance was fundamentally flawed in this instance. My explicit request was for 'Automated Prior Art Comparison and Discrepancy Analysis' for a critical Office Action. Being brought to a general 'My Legal Calendar' page is a complete failure of the agentic flow. The assistant should have understood the urgency and directed me straight to the relevant analytical tools, not a passive calendar."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "From this calendar page, there's absolutely no indication of the powerful, patent-specific workflows I *know* this system should offer, like claim amendment simulations or response drafting. If the assistant leads me here by mistake, I'm left stranded without any breadcrumbs or navigation elements to help me discover or access the actual tools I need. This page does not contribute to workflow discovery at all."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "This page feels like a silo. There are no clear navigation links or a persistent menu bar to other parts of the system â€“ like the patent application dashboard, document repositories, or specific client files. If the assistant misfires, as it did in this case, I have no obvious alternative route to get to my work without going back and potentially restarting my interaction with the assistant, which is incredibly inefficient when deadlines are looming."
