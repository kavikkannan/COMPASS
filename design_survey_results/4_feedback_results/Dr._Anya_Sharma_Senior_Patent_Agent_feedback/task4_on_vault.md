**Page Name:** Vault Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1. How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2. How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3. **Open Feedback:** "I am quite frustrated. I was specifically trying to use the 'Response Drafting Assistant' to generate a draft for Aura AI's Office Action response, and I've landed on this 'Vault' page. This page only shows a list of my cases and an option to create a new one. I expected to be taken directly to a page or a module where I could initiate the drafting process, perhaps after selecting the specific case, but there is absolutely no indication of how to begin drafting an OA response from here, let alone an AI-assisted one. It feels like I've been sent to the wrong part of the system entirely."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1. **Readability:** "The main headings like 'Vault' and 'Your Cases' are clear enough. However, the descriptive text under each case card, such as 'Petitioner: kavikkannan' or 'Last Modified: 7/3/2025', is quite small and uses a light grey font against a white background. If I had to quickly scan through many cases to identify the Aura AI application, this small, light text would be a strain to read and slow me down considerably."
2. **Layout & Spacing:** "The layout is very clean and spacious, with a clear grid for the case cards. While this is good for displaying cases, it feels incredibly sparse for a critical workflow. There's a lot of unused white space, particularly below the case cards, which could have been utilized for a 'Quick Actions' panel or direct links to key prosecution workflows relevant to a case once selected. It feels like a very basic file explorer rather than an advanced legal tech platform."
3. **Color & Visuals:** "The color scheme is minimalist and professional, but it lacks any visual elements that scream 'advanced AI capabilities' or 'drafting tool.' The folder icons are standard, and the 'Create case' card is highlighted in blue, which correctly draws attention to its function. However, there are no icons, buttons, or visual cues on this page that even hint at the 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation' functionality I'm trying to use. It doesn't guide my eye towards the task I need to perform."
4. **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression is that this page is a static repository, not an interactive workspace for complex legal tasks like patent prosecution. It's too simplistic and lacks the functional depth I'd expect from a platform designed to streamline my work. It's essentially a list of folders, not a gateway to strategic drafting. It doesn't help me overcome any of my daily frustrations; it just shows me my caseload."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1. **Feature Usefulness:** "The 'Create case' feature is useful for starting new files, and the individual case cards allow me to theoretically click into a specific case. However, for my immediate need of 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation and Review,' neither of these features is directly useful on this page. Clicking into a case might *eventually* lead me to the tools, but this page itself provides no direct utility for my task."
2. **Missing Features:** "I am actively looking for the 'Response Drafting Assistant' or any obvious way to initiate the drafting process for an Office Action response. I also expected a search bar or robust filtering options to quickly locate the Aura AI application within my large portfolio, as clicking through multiple pages of cases isn't efficient."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1. **Assistant Guidance:** "If the assistant, as the primary interface, led me to *this* 'Vault' page when I explicitly indicated I needed to generate and review an Office Action response draft, then its guidance is severely lacking. I expected it to either take me directly to the 'Response Drafting Assistant' module for the Aura AI case, or at the very least, provide a clear, prominent button or prompt *on this page* that says 'Start OA Response Draft' after confirming which case I need to work on. It feels disconnected from the intelligent agentic flow it's supposed to offer."
2. **Workflow Discovery:** "From this page, there is no way to discover any of the advanced workflows like 'Automated Prior Art Comparison,' 'Prosecution History Synthesis,' or 'Claim Amendment Impact Simulation' that I would need *before* drafting a response. This page only shows me case files, not the strategic tools I rely on. I can't discern what other patent prosecution workflows are available through the system from this high-level view."
3. **Cross-Page Navigation:** "While I can click on a case card to presumably go to a case detail page, there are no clear navigational elements *on this 'Vault' page* that would allow me to jump to other critical parts of the system, like a dashboard of active prosecution workflows, an analytics page, or a global 'AI Tools' section. If the assistant is my primary interface, I shouldn't have to guess where to go next after landing on a generic page like this."
