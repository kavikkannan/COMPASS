**Page Name:** Document Editor Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1.  How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2.  How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3.  **Open Feedback:** "I am extremely frustrated. I just finished dissecting new prior art and simulating claim amendments, and I expected to be greeted by a **'Response Drafting Assistant'** that would intelligently pull that work together for this critical Aura AI Office Action. Instead, I'm looking at a generic document editor with a document titled 'APPLICATION TO SUE AS AN INDIGENT PERSON' – which is completely irrelevant to my patent prosecution task! There's no clear 'Generate OA Response' button, no prompt to import my prior analyses, and the AI assistant seems geared only toward editing text I've *already* written, not helping me generate a complex, strategic legal argument from the ground up based on the outputs of the previous stages."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1.  **Readability:** "The text within the document canvas is clear enough, though it's the wrong document. The descriptions under the 'Quick Actions' in the sidebar ('Make language more formal,' 'Improve enforceability') are a bit small and light grey, making them slightly harder to scan quickly, though the main action titles are fine. I'm straining a little to make out the full context of those suggestions."
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** "The overall two-column layout is clean and provides ample space for the document itself. The rich-text editor toolbar is well-spaced, but the sidebar, while organized, doesn't immediately convey any patent-specific tools. It feels like a very standard setup, not tailored to the specialized, high-stakes work I'm doing in patent prosecution. The 'Legal Commands' dropdown feels a bit hidden in its current arrangement; given its potential importance, it could be more prominent."
3.  **Color & Visuals:** "The visual design is professional and clean, with a good use of white space, which I appreciate for focus. The muted greens and blues for interactive elements are pleasant. However, there's nothing visually that indicates this is a specialized *patent* drafting tool. It lacks any visual cues (like an icon of a patent, or a specific heading for 'Patent Response Drafting') that would help me immediately confirm I'm in the right place for my specific task."
4.  **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression is that this is a perfectly capable *general* legal document editor with some useful *general* AI text manipulation features. However, it completely misses the mark for my critical task of drafting a complex patent Office Action response. It feels far too generic, lacking the specialized tools, context, and integration I need to efficiently address new prior art and enablement rejections. I'm not seeing the advanced 'Response Drafting Assistant' that should leverage all the detailed analysis I just performed."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1.  **Feature Usefulness:** "The basic rich-text editing features are standard and necessary for any document, but they aren't specific to my task. The 'Quick Actions' like 'Strengthen Language' or 'Rephrase Clause' could be marginally useful for refining a sentence *after* I've drafted it, but they don't help me *generate* the initial strategic response itself. The 'Document Metrics' are a nice-to-have, but utterly irrelevant when I'm trying to figure out how to even start drafting my response. The 'Legal Commands' dropdown is too vague – I need something specific like 'Address 103 Rejection' or 'Formulate Enablement Argument', not a generic 'Choose a legal command...'"
2.  **Missing Features:** "I desperately need a **'Generate Patent OA Response'** button or a clear command to start drafting based on my prior analysis. I need direct integration points to **import the output from the prior art comparison (Task 1), the prosecution history synthesis (Task 2), and the proposed claim amendments (Task 3).** There's no visible feature to **'Flag file wrapper estoppel issues'** or **'Check consistency with previous responses'**, which is absolutely critical for patent prosecution. I also expected to see a template or structured guide specifically for an Office Action response, especially for a second non-final action, that would prompt me for arguments against specific rejections (102, 103, 112)."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1.  **Assistant Guidance:** "The 'Legal AI Assistant' in the sidebar is present, but it's not *assisting* me at all for *my specific task*. It just says 'No Selection' and offers generic 'Legal Commands' or 'Quick Actions.' I expected it to be proactive, perhaps saying something like: 'Dr. Sharma, you're drafting an OA response for Aura AI. Based on your prior art analysis and claim amendments, I can generate a preliminary draft now. Would you like to focus on arguments against the new prior art (Paper X) or the reiterated enablement rejection (112(a))?' It's completely passive and out of context for my critical workflow."
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** "I cannot easily discover patent prosecution workflows from this page. The assistant seems stuck in a generic 'legal document editing' mode. I need to know *where* to access the specialized 'Response Drafting Assistant' for patent OAs, or if this *is* it, how to tell it to leverage the sophisticated work I just completed in the previous steps. There's no clear navigation to other patent-specific modules."
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** "This page feels like a dead end. I came here directly from the 'Claim Amendment Impact Simulation' (Task 3), and I need to incorporate those results. There's no clear link back to my detailed prior art analysis or the prosecution history summary. It feels like the system dropped me into a general editor without carrying over any context from my previous actions. I expect seamless integration and a clear, guided path through the entire OA response workflow, not just being left in a generic editing environment."
