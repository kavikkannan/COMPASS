**Page Name:** Vault Create Case Page

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
1.  How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2.  How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3.  **Open Feedback:** "This is absolutely not what I asked for! I am trying to analyze the prosecution history for Aura AI's critical second Office Action, specifically to synthesize enablement arguments. I need to be in a 'Prosecution History Summary' module, not on a 'Create New Case' page. This is a complete waste of my precious time, especially with a tight deadline looming. I expected to see a timeline of examiner rejections and our responses, not an empty form for a new filing."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1.  **Readability:** The labels like "Case Name" and "Description" are clear enough, and the placeholder text gives good hints. However, I'm simply frustrated to be reading *any* of this on a page so irrelevant to my pressing need.
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** The layout is clean and simple, with plenty of white space. For a "create new case" page, it's not overly cluttered, but it feels very generic. It doesn't look like a sophisticated patent prosecution platform; it could be for any type of legal case, which makes me question if the platform is truly specialized enough for my work.
3.  **Color & Visuals:** The blue "Create Case" button is standard and visible. The overall palette is very neutral and perhaps a bit bland for a cutting-edge AI platform. There's nothing visually that screams "patent-specific" or "AI-powered analysis." Given my frustration, I'm not focused on aesthetics, but rather functionality.
4.  **Overall Impression:** My overall impression is one of intense frustration and misdirection. This page is minimalist and generic, but that's irrelevant because it's the wrong page entirely. It provides no context, no navigation, and no tools relevant to my actual task. It feels like a dead end for my current workflow.

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1.  **Feature Usefulness:** For my current task of "Prosecution History Synthesis and Argument Recommendation," this page offers precisely zero useful features. All the fields are for inputting new case information, which is the opposite of what I need to do right now. I need to *extract and analyze* information from an *existing* case.
2.  **Missing Features:** I am missing *everything* I was supposed to be doing! I need the "Prosecution History Summary" module, an interactive timeline of enablement rejections, tools to analyze prior art from *within* an existing case, and argument recommendations based on successful firm outcomes. This page has none of that. It doesn't even have a search bar to find my existing "Aura AI" case.

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1.  **Assistant Guidance:** The assistant has completely failed to guide me to the right features. If I asked for "Prosecution History Synthesis," landing on "Create New Case" is a critical misstep. This wastes my time and makes me question the intelligence of the agentic flow system. I expected a direct link or immediate display of the relevant prosecution history, not a form to start from scratch.
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** I cannot easily discover *any* relevant workflows from this page. I'm just looking at a form. There are no sidebars, no navigation menus, no "back to dashboard" options, and certainly no links to "Prior Art Comparison" or "Claim Amendment Impact Simulation," which are the tools I need.
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** There is no visible cross-page navigation here at all. I am stranded on a "Create New Case" page without any clear breadcrumbs or menu options to return to a case overview, a client portfolio, or any of the advanced analysis tools the platform supposedly offers. How do I get back to my "Aura AI" application's details? This is severely inefficient.
