**Page Name:** VAULT CASE DETAIL PAGE
**Part A: User Experience & Flow**
*(Rate on a scale of 1-5, where 1 = Very Difficult and 5 = Very Easy)*
1.  How easy was it to start the task on this page? `1`
2.  How clear was the path to completing the task from here? `1`
3.  **Open Feedback:** "I just received a critical second Office Action for Aura AI, and I specifically need to analyze new prior art, dissect the prosecution history on enablement, and simulate claim amendments. I expected the assistant to take me directly to a specialized analytical tool, but I've landed on a basic file management page. This page is completely irrelevant to my immediate, strategic needs and feels like a significant setback when I'm under such a tight deadline."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**
1.  **Readability:** "The general font sizes for file names and metadata fields are acceptable, but the 'Invalid Date' displayed in the 'Last Modified' column for the file is a glaring issue – it's unhelpful and raises concerns about data integrity. Also, the 'Cancel' link in the 'Case Metadata' header is extremely light and almost disappears against the background, making it easy to overlook. The 'View' and 'Download' action links also lack sufficient contrast."
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** "The division into 'Case Files' and 'Case Metadata' panels is clear, but within the 'Case Files' table, the columns feel quite compressed, especially 'Last Modified' which seems cut off. In the metadata section, the 'Add field...' dropdown and its 'Add' button are disproportionately small compared to the other input fields, making them less discoverable for an important function like customizing metadata."
3.  **Color & Visuals:** "The overall aesthetic is very subdued, which can be clean, but the light blue used for various links and actions ('← Back to Vault', 'View', 'Download', 'Cancel' in metadata header) makes them visually weak and hard to quickly identify. The 'Save' button has good visual weight, but other interactive elements need more prominence. The 'Invalid Date' as a visual error is particularly frustrating."
4.  **Overall Impression:** "This page feels like a very generic administrative tool for basic file and metadata management. While useful for organization, it offers absolutely no specialized functionality for advanced patent prosecution. It's a 'document vault,' not a 'strategic analysis workbench.' I expected a high-tech platform to provide powerful analytical visualization, not just a list of files."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**
1.  **Feature Usefulness:** "The 'Upload files' feature is a necessary first step to get the new prior art into the system, and searching existing files and editing general case metadata are helpful for basic case administration. However, these features are purely foundational. They do not, in any way, assist with the core tasks of comparing prior art, analyzing prosecution history for enablement arguments, or simulating claim scope impact, which are my critical current needs."
2.  **Missing Features:** "The key features for my tasks are entirely absent from this page: there's no 'Automated Prior Art Comparison and Discrepancy Analysis' tool, no 'Prosecution History Synthesis' module specifically for tracking enablement arguments, no 'Claim Amendment Impact Simulation and Visualization,' and certainly no 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation.' This page is missing all the strategic, intelligence-driven features that I was promised this legal tech product would offer."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**
1.  **Assistant Guidance:** "I explicitly needed guidance on addressing a critical second Office Action. The assistant, as the 'primary interface,' completely missed the mark by bringing me to this general file management page. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the urgency and the analytical nature of my request. I need direct access to the relevant analysis tools, not a repository. It's a significant failure in agentic flow."
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** "From this 'Vault Case Detail Page,' there is no obvious way to discover or initiate any of the advanced patent prosecution workflows, such as 'Prior Art Analysis,' 'Claim Scoping,' or 'Response Drafting.' I'm stuck in an administrative view with no clear path forward. I shouldn't have to leave this page and re-query the assistant just to find the tools I need."
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** "While there's a '← Back to Vault' link, there are no direct links or intelligent navigation options from *this* page to the crucial analytical modules I require. This means I have to go back to a more general view, potentially losing context, and then try to find the right tool, which is a waste of my valuable time. I expected more seamless, context-aware navigation across specialized functions."
