Okay, this is completely off-track. I'm Dr. Anya Sharma, and I'm staring down a critical second Office Action for Aura AI. I need to be dissecting new prior art, overcoming enablement rejections, and drafting a strategic response, not looking at my calendar! This system is supposed to be *helping* me, not derailing my workflow.

Here's my feedback, reflecting my current frustration and the urgent nature of my actual tasks:

**Page Name:** CALENDAR PAGE

**Part A: User Experience & Flow**

1.  **How easy was it to start the task on this page?** `1`
2.  **How clear was the path to completing the task from here?** `1`
3.  **Open Feedback:** "I am utterly perplexed and frankly, quite frustrated. My task is 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation and Review' for a high-priority Office Action for Aura AI. I was expecting to land on a page with tools for prior art comparison, prosecution history analysis, or at the very least, a drafting interface. Instead, I'm staring at a calendar. This page offers absolutely *nothing* to help me with my urgent response. I have no idea how to even begin my actual task from here."

**Part B: Specific UI & Design Details**

1.  **Readability:** "The 'My Legal Calendar' title is clear enough, as are the month and day labels. The event entries like 'Lexamplify...' are quite small and truncated, though. If I actually *were* here to manage my schedule, I'd find it hard to quickly scan and understand what each event is without hovering or clicking, which would be an annoyance given the volume of tasks I manage. The navigation for the month is clear."
2.  **Layout & Spacing:** "The calendar itself is clean and the spacing between the days is adequate. The navigation for 'October 2025' and the arrows is logically placed. The 'Add Event' button is prominent and clear. As a standalone calendar, it looks functional, but my mind is racing with my actual urgent tasks, so it’s hard to objectively appreciate the layout when it's so irrelevant to what I need."
3.  **Color & Visuals:** "The blue accent for the current day (15th) is helpful for orientation. The 'Add Event' button stands out well. The subtle blue dots next to the events indicate items, but they don't convey priority or type at a glance, which could be useful if this were actually a relevant page for me. The overall color scheme is calm, but again, I'm looking for a powerful analytical tool, not calm."
4.  **Overall Impression:** "My overall impression is one of extreme irrelevance and annoyance. This page is a complete non-sequitur to my immediate, critical task. While the calendar itself appears to be a reasonably well-designed calendar, being directed here when I need to perform sophisticated AI-assisted patent analysis and drafting makes it feel like an obstacle rather than a tool. It's clean, but it's the *wrong* clean page."

**Part C: Feature Evaluation & Gaps**

1.  **Feature Usefulness:** "The features present – month, week, day, agenda views, and the ability to add events – would be useful *if I were trying to manage my schedule*. I appreciate that it integrates with Google Calendar for deadlines, but this is not what I needed to do. I needed to analyze prior art, review prosecution history, simulate claim amendments, and draft a response. None of those crucial, high-value patent prosecution features are here. It's like asking for a scalpel and being handed a date book."
2.  **Missing Features:** "I am missing *everything*! I need the 'AI-Assisted Draft Response Generation and Review' interface, the 'Automated Prior Art Comparison and Discrepancy Analysis' tool, the 'Prosecution History Synthesis and Argument Recommendation' module, and the 'Claim Amendment Impact Simulation and Visualization' feature. This page is devoid of any functionality related to patent prosecution, which is the core of my work right now."

**Part D: Assistant Integration & Agentic Flow**

1.  **Assistant Guidance:** "The assistant has critically failed in guiding me. It should have directly navigated me to the 'Response Drafting Assistant' or a dashboard relevant to patent prosecution workflows, especially considering the urgency of an Office Action. Landing me on a calendar page when I have a complex technical response due is a complete misdirection and a major breakdown in the 'intelligent agentic flow system' that was promised. It provided no guidance whatsoever to my *actual* task."
2.  **Workflow Discovery:** "From this calendar page, it is impossible for me to discover the patent prosecution workflows. There are no links, no prompts, no contextual cues that would lead me to the tools for drafting or analysis. If the assistant is the primary interface, it needs to be far more intelligent about understanding my context and directing me appropriately. I should not have to manually search for critical workflows after such a clear prompt."
3.  **Cross-Page Navigation:** "There is no clear cross-page navigation visible here that would take me back to or to the appropriate patent prosecution modules. I don't see a main menu, a 'home' button for the patent-specific tools, or anything that would allow me to easily correct this navigation error. I expected a seamless transition to the drafting environment, or at least a visible breadcrumb trail or side navigation to all the core platform features. I feel stuck."
