*   **Name & Role:** Dr. Anya Sharma, Senior Patent Agent
*   **Domain & Specialization:** Intellectual Property Law, Patent Prosecution & Portfolio Management (Biotech)
*   **Bio/Background (2-3 sentences):** Anya holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and transitioned into patent law, leveraging her deep scientific expertise. She works at a mid-sized IP boutique firm, managing a diverse portfolio of biotech clients ranging from startups to established pharmaceutical companies, guiding them through the patent application process from invention disclosure to grant. Her role demands meticulous attention to detail, a strong understanding of complex technical concepts, and adherence to strict deadlines.
*   **Primary Goals (3 bullet points):**
    *   Streamline the drafting and prosecution of patent applications, reducing manual data entry and repetitive tasks.
    *   Ensure accurate and compliant tracking of all patent deadlines and communications with patent offices worldwide.
    *   Facilitate secure, version-controlled collaboration with inventors, clients, and internal legal teams on highly technical documents.
*   **Frustrations/Pain Points (3 bullet points):**
    *   Managing multiple versions of complex technical documents (e.g., patent claims, specifications) across different platforms, leading to version control issues.
    *   Manually cross-referencing information between internal databases, external patent office portals, and client communications to track application status and deadlines.
    *   Inefficient communication and feedback loops with inventors and clients on highly technical aspects of an invention, often requiring multiple email exchanges and ad-hoc calls.
*   **Tech Savviness (Scale of 1-5):** 4
*   **Typical Tasks within Product (3-4 examples):**
    *   Draft and edit patent claims and specifications using templated structures and integrated legal language tools.
    *   Upload and organize invention disclosures, linking them to relevant prior art and legal research.
    *   Track the status of patent applications, receiving automated alerts for upcoming deadlines (e.g., Office Action responses, maintenance fees).
    *   Securely share draft applications with inventors and clients for review, collecting feedback and approvals within the platform.
